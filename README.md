# Image Learning Lab

An educational resource for all ages. Want curious users to walk away having made progress toward understanding the following concept:
- Images are data
- Images can be generated just as any set of numbers can, but it *means* something to *measure*
- Critical thinking about transformations of images
- Insight into what edit settings are doing to images in apps such as Instagram, etc.


## Project

There are two parallel goals of this project. The first is to be a highly intuitive tool for learning to complement different topics within science, engineering, and art. The second is to be fully transparent, open, and *hackable*. The entire stack from the front end to the image processing is written in Python with libraries that are used by industry professionals without overcomplication; a curious student can dig into any aspect of what the app is doing and even maek their own modifications.


## Dev
